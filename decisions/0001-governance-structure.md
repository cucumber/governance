## Summary

Establish a governance structure for the project to provide a clear process for, and record of, project-wide decisions.

## PR URL

TBA

## Problem

Up until now our governance structure has been quite ad-hoc. Core team members would discuss and agree things as they came up, and actions would be taken. These were often recorded in the notes of the weekly meetings, but that is hard to go back and find, not to mention it is publicly editable. This has worked well for us up to now, but lacks a level of structure and transparency that is 1) good to have anyway and 2) a requirement for some potential sources of funding.

We want to put something more structured in place, but not overdo it with a lot of process.

## Proposal

- Use this repository to make and record governance decisions, like ADRs
- Require a majority - but prefer a consensus - among the core team
- Decisions without cross-platform impact are out of scope

## Decision

**Accepted**: The project will adopt this immediately.
