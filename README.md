  <b>Project governance structure and decisions</b>
</p>

The Cucumber open source project follows a collaborative governance model where major decisions are made through discussion and consensus among the core team members. This repository serves as the center of governance for Cucumber. It contains the governance structure, decision-making process, and historical records of project-wide decisions.

## Scope

Not all decisions should be made here. Specifically, these governance decisions should be:

- **Project-wide**: decisions that only affect one platform can (and should), be made externally by the responsible core maintainer(s)
- **Non-technical**: almost all technical design can happen in discussions and issues on relevant repos

A few examples of in-scope topics here:

- Sources and distribution of funding
- Adopting or releasing of existent or new(er), projects
- Communications
- The governance structure itself

## Process

To propose a change:

1. **Create a pull request**: Submit a PR to this repo with your proposed decision document in the `decisions/` folder
2. **Discussion**: Present and discuss the proposal at the weekly contributors meeting (Thursdays at 4pm UK time [in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1260995505018765393/1273657925331845191)) if you can attend
3. **Consensus building**: Work toward consensus among core team members, or at minimum achieve a majority vote
4. **Finalisation**: Update the decision document based on feedback and merge the pull request once approved

## Core team

Cucumber is maintained (and governed) by the following core team members:

- **[Matt Wynne](https://github.com/mattwynne)** - Project lead
- **[M.P. Korstanje](https://github.com/mpkorstanje)** - Core maintainer, JVM
- **[David Goss](https://github.com/davidjgoss)** - Core maintainer, JavaScript
- **[Luke Hill](https://github.com/luke-hill)** - Core maintainer, Ruby

- **[Seb Rose](https://github.com/sebrose)** - Co-author of _The Cucumber Book_

## Decision records

All governance decisions are documented in the [`decisions/`](./decisions/) folder. Each decision follows a structured format similar to Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to capture context, rationale, and outcomes.
